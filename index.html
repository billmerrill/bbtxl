    <h1>What is Bicycle Beer Time eXtra Large?</h1>
    <p>BBTXL's (pronounced bubba-tix-el) are week-long, supported, bike tours. The first week-long ride took place in 2013, and there's roughly one ride per year.</p>
    <p>For many of us, this was our first experience bike touring. We generally camp overnight (preferably somewhere with a shower or a fresh body of water) and seek out breweries as food stops.</p>
    <p>It's hard to explain the magic of these trips. Imagine your day being reduced to biking with 15-20 of your friends, punctuated with good meals, ice cream stops, and (of course) craft beers.</p>
    <p>This site documents these trips, and hopefully inspires you to plan your own trip!</p>
