  <p>The trip that started it all! Over 3 days we visited Dark Horse, Bell's, and ended at New Holland. It started in Ann Arbor on 2012/05/25 and ended in Holland on 2012/05/27. Instead of meticulously clicking point by point in an online mapping applications, the route cue sheets were written on graph paper, scanned, and printed.</p>
  <p>It was a simpler time.</p>

  <h3>Day 1: Ann Arbor to Marshall</h3>

      <p>The route goes west, so these maps read right-to-left. The bottom map is the second half of the route for the first day.</p>
