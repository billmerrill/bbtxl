        <p>This BBTXL dared to ask the question "what if Bell's and Founders were lunch stops??"</p>
        <p>We iterated on the 2013 route, trying to add miles after Marshall and shorten the day riding in to Traverse City. The riding along Lake Michigan was beautiful, and we included as much rail-to-trail as we could. Although we didn't have any 95 mi days this time around, the days weren't exactly short either.</p>
        <p>This trip started in Ann Arbor on Saturday, 2021/08/14 and we rolled in to Traverse City on Thurdsay, 2021/08/19. It was good timing; the week before a windstorm swept through Michigan knocking down trees and powerlines that were mostly cleaned up by the time we started. The weather was hot, but clear, and there was lots of swimming in Lake Michigan at the end of the day's ride.</p>

    <h3>Day 1: Ann Arbor to Marshall</h3>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="column">
        <p>The route from Ann Arbor to Jackson is one we've done several times, and included some of the recent sections of the <a href="https://b2btrail.org/">Border to Border Trail</a>. After a refreshing lunch at <a href="https://www.grandriverbrewery.com/">Grand River Brewery</a>, we took the <a href="https://www.co.jackson.mi.us/1218/Falling-Waters-Trail">Falling Waters Trail</a> to Concord, and then came back north to visit <a href="https://darkhorsebrewery.com/">Dark Horse Brewery</a> in Marshall. Even though the wind storm was 4 days ago, there were still power outages along the way. Our planned afternoon ice cream stop was without power, as was our original camp destination <a href="https://www.campturkeyville.com/">Camp Turkeyville</a> (yes, it is a real place); instead, we returned to our 2013 campsite at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Tri-Lake-Trails-Inc-Tri-Lake-Trails-Campground-348096938714000/">Tri Lake Trails Campground</a>.</p>
        <p>Several folks on this trip are associated with <a href="https://commoncycle.org/">Common Cycle</a> and at this campground we had our first customer - a kid with a squeaky chain got a maintenance crash-course.</p>

    <h3>Day 2: Marshall to Yankee Springs</h3>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="column">
          <p>This was a short day on the 2013 trip, so we stopped at <a href="http://www.bellsbeer.com/">Bell's Brewery</a> for lunch and continued on to camp at Yankee Springs. You can't not stop at Bell's. The food was great, they have beers they don't distribute at the tap room, and an incredible concert by <a href="http://www.jordanhamiltonmusic.com/">Jordan Hamilton</a></p>
          <p>A theme of this trip was stitching together trails, and this day was no exception as we did part of the <a href="https://www.kalcounty.com/parks/krvt/">Kalamazoo River Valley Trail</a>.</p>
