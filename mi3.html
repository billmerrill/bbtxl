        <p>This BBTXL dared to ask the question "what if Bell's and Founders were lunch stops??".</p>
        <p>We iterated on the 2013 route, trying to add miles after Marshall and shorten the day riding in to Traverse City. The riding along Lake Michigan was beautiful, and we included as much rail-to-trail as we could. Although we didn't have any 95 mi days this time around, the days weren't exactly short either.</p>
        <p>This trip started in Ann Arbor on Saturday, 2021/08/14 and we rolled in to Traverse City on Thurdsay, 2021/08/19. It was good timing; the week before a windstorm swept through Michigan knocking down trees and powerlines that were mostly cleaned up by the time we started. The weather was hot, but clear, and there was lots of swimming in Lake Michigan at the end of the day's ride.</p>
