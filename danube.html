    <p>Dave Helder took BBTXLs to a whole new level with this trip. There were two stages, each a week long, both somewhat following the Euro Velo 6 route: <a href="https://en.eurovelo.com/ev6/from-passau-to-vienna">Passau to Vienna</a> and <a href="https://en.eurovelo.com/ev6/from-vienna-to-budapest">Vienna to Budapest</a>. There are plenty of cities and towns along the route, and you can take it at whatever pace you feel comfortable. You're following the Danube downstream, so there's much less elevation gain, and most days were short so we had the afternoon to explore various cities along the way.</p>
    <p>Instead of trying to transport your bike, most of us rented bikes from <a href="https://www.viennaexplorer.com/">Vienna Explorer</a>. The bikes were fine, although you should bring some basic bike tools with you. Our bikes had Dunlop tube valves, which you can inflate with a Schrader-compatible pump.</p>
    <p>Folks doing both weeks started biking in Passau on 2019/09/09, arriving in Vienna on 2019/09/13 where more folks joined. After a rest day, the biking continued, ending in Budapest on 2019/09/20.</p>

    <h3>Day 6: Hanging out in Vienna</h3>
    <p>There are many ways to spend a day in Vienna. We visited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prater">famous Prater</a> and went into the old town for a <a href="https://www.sacher.com/en/original-sacher-torte/">Sacher-Torte</a>.</p>

    <h3>Day 7: Vienna to Bratislava</h3>
    <p>This route passes right through the old town center of Bratislava. The city has dramatically grown, but the town center has lots of old architecture, restaurants, and shops.</p>

    <h3>Day 8: Bratislava to Mosonmagyaróvár</h3>
    <p>There's lots to explore in this small town. We finished early so we had some time to enjoy the thermal baths.</p>
    <iframe src="https://ridewithgps.com/embeds?type=route&id=30311729&title=BBTXL%3A%20Danube%20-%20Day%208&sampleGraph=true" style="width: 1px; min-width: 100%; height: 700px; border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

    <h3>Day 9: Mosonmagyaróvár to Győr</h3>
    <p>Be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.kaptalandomb.hu/hu/kiallitas/3/puspokvar-toronykilato/">Püspökvár lookout tower</a>. During World War II the bishop hid people in the lower levels; there's a memorial in the room where the Nazis discovered this and shot him.</p>

    <h3>Day 10: Győr to Komárom</h3>
    <p>This town straddles the river, with half in Hungary and half in Slovakia. We camped overnight on the Hungary side, but popped over the bridge to Slovakia to see the old town center.</p>
    <iframe src="https://ridewithgps.com/embeds?type=route&id=30311738&title=BBTXL%3A%20Danube%20-%20Day%2010&sampleGraph=true" style="width: 1px; min-width: 100%; height: 700px; border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

    <h3>Day 11: Komárom to Esztergom</h3>
    <p>It's on the top of a hill, but the old town has spectacular views of the area and beautiful old buildings. The basilica was built around 1000 CE, and was wrapping up its millennial celebration.

    <h3>Day 12: Esztergom to Budapest</h3>
    <p>It's always jarring transitioning from small towns and pastoral landscapes into a big city, but we found Budapest to be very friendly to in terms of people and bikes.</p>
    <iframe src="https://ridewithgps.com/embeds?type=route&id=30311751&title=BBTXL%3A%20Danube%20-%20Day%2012&sampleGraph=true" style="width: 1px; min-width: 100%; height: 700px; border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

    <h3>Day 13: Hang out in Budapest</h3>
    <p>We visited the <a href="http://budapestmarkethall.com/">Great Market Hall</a> and took the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Castle_Hill_Funicular">funicular</a> up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buda_Castle">Buda Castle</a>. There were a number of art print shops, like <a href="https://printa.hu/">Printa</a> that are worth checking out.</p>
